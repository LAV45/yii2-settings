Settings form
===================

This allows you to maintain arbitrary settings for the components in your project.


## You can see for yourself how much this simple:

* [SettingsForm](models/SettingsForm.php)
* [SettingsController](controllers/SettingsController.php)
* [settings](views/settings/settings.php)
